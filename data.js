Sheriff: "Weight?"

Husband: "Don't know. Not slim, not really fat."

Sheriff: "Color of eyes?"

Husband: "Sort of brown I think. Never really noticed."

Sheriff: "Color of hair?"

Husband: "Changes a couple times a year. Maybe dark brown now. I can't remember."

Sheriff: "What was she wearing?"

Husband: "Could have been pants, or maybe a skirt or shorts. I don't know exactly."

Sheriff: "What kind of car did she go in?"

Husband: "She went in my truck."

Sheriff: "What kind of truck was it?"

Husband: "A 2016 Brilliant Diesel Grey Pearlcoat Ram Limited 4X4 with 6.4 l Hemi V8 engine ordered with the Ram Box bar and fridge option, led lighting, backup and front camera, Moose hide leather heated and cooled seats, climate controlled air conditioning.

I am feeling pretty bad because it looks like I won't be able to plant my kumara garden this year. I'm just getting too old to be digging up the hard ground for my garden plot. I know if you were here, all my troubles would be over because being a good son I know you would dig the garden plot for me.

For god's sake don't dig that garden. That's where I buried the bodies.

At 4am the next morning, the Whangarei C.I.B and the local police arrived with a search warrant and dug up the entire area without finding any bodies. They apologised profusely and left.

Go ahead and plant your kumara now. That's the best I could do under the circumstances.

"Rome? Why would anyone want to go there? It's crowded and dirty. You're crazy to go to Rome. So, how are you getting there?" 
 
"We're taking Continental," was the reply. "We got a great rate!" 
 
"Continental?" exclaimed the hairdresser. “That’s a terrible airline. Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they are always late. So, where are you staying in Rome?" 
 
"We'll be at this exclusive little place over on Rome's Tiber River called Teste." 
 
"Don't go any further. I know that place. Everybody thinks it’s gonna be something special and exclusive, but it's really a dump." 
 
"We're going to go to see the Vatican and maybe get to see the Pope." 
 
"That's rich," laughed the hairdresser. “You and a million other people trying to see him. He'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You're going to need it." 
 
A month later, the woman again came in for a hairdo. The hairdresser asked her about her trip to Rome. 
 
"It was wonderful," explained the woman, "not only were we on time in one of Continental's brand new planes, but it was overbooked, and they bumped us up to first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a handsome 28-year-old steward who waited on me hand and foot.  And the hotel was great! They'd just finished a $5 million remodeling job, and now it's a jewel, the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us their owner's suite at no extra charge!" 
 
"Well," muttered the hairdresser, "that's all well and good, but I know you didn't get to see the Pope." 
 
"Actually, we were quite lucky, because as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder, and explained that the Pope likes to meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the Pope would personally greet me.  Sure enough, five minutes later, the Pope walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down and he spoke a few words to me."

He tried a third version. 'Dear Jesus, I could be a good boy if I tried hard and especially if I had a new bike.' He read that one too, but he still wasn't satisfied. 
So, he decided to go out for a walk while he thought about a better approach. After a short time he passed a house with a small statue of the Virgin Mary in the front garden.
